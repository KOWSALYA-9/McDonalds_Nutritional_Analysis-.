python
import pandas as pd

# Replace 'file_path' with the path to your Excel file
file_path = 'your_excel_file.xlsx'

# Load the Excel file
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())


If you want to work with a CSV file instead, you can modify the code:

python
# Replace 'file_path' with the path to your CSV file
file_path = 'your_csv_file.csv'

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
