# McDonald's Nutritional Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items, including calories, fat, carbs, and protein. Using Tableau, we visualize these data points to compare healthy and unhealthy options, identify trends, and offer recommendations for healthier eating.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Data was sourced from the Prisme portal (upGrad).
- **Data Cleaning:** The data was cleaned using Tableau to ensure consistency.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Key nutritional metrics were analyzed and visualized using Tableau.

## Key Features
- **Calories Comparison:** Visualize the calorie counts of menu items.
- **Nutritional Breakdown:** Charts showing fat, carbs, and protein.
- **Healthy vs Unhealthy Items:** Identifying healthier alternatives.
- **Displaying key charatersitics of each nutrients 

## Findings and Insights
- **Top 5 Unhealthy Items:** Items like Big Mac and Double Cheeseburger are high in calories and fat.
